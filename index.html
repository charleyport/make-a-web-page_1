    <h1> My Notes</h1>
      <div class="summary">
        <p> In Unit 1 we learned that the main type of document on the web is 
        <em>HTML</em>. We also learned that web files can be 
       <em>plain text, HTML, images, videos, and music.</em></p>
     </div>
       <div class="header">
         <p><b>HTML-</b>stands for <em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em>. 
        It utilizes -text content, -markup, references to other 
        documents, and -links to other pages</p>
      </div>
      <div class="next">
        <p><b>Basic HTML Vocabulary-</b>consists of</p> 
        <p>o A Tag- An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag and closing tag.
        Some tags (called <em><b>"void"</b></em>tags) do not require a closing tag</p>
        <p>o An Element- An HTML element consists of the content contain within the opening 
        and closing tag.</p>
        <p>o An Attribute- is a property of an <em> HTML</em> element.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="summary">
        <p>I have learned the <em> so far</em> there are two types of elements:</p>
      </div>
      <div class="next">
        <p><b>Inline</b> and <b>Block</b></p>
        <p>Examples of Inline are: "b", "em", and "img". An example of a block element is "p". 
        A block element encapsulates the content into an 
        <em>"invisible box"</em>. "Span" and "Div" are also examples of inline and block elements.
        I have much more to learn as I cannot yet use the left and right arrow
        in my text without the code trying to create a new element.</p>
        <p> An example of a tag that uses an HTML Attribute woulds be the "a" or anchor tag. 
        It would contain an attribute, followed by a "value", the content, and a closing tag.</p>

    <h1> My Stage 1Notes</h1>
    <div class="summary">
        <p>Moving further into :<b>Webpages,Documents,and Structure</b>,I have learned how the  
        <b>HTML</b> tag
        and <b>DOM</b> or "Document Object Model". create the elements that form a <em>tree-like</em>
        structure while <b>CSS</b> controls the style elements of a page.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="jobaid">CCS fonts and formats have a specific hierarchy. The analogy used was in regard to 
      laws.<br>
        <ul>
          <li>1.National Laws-govern the entire country (document)<br></li>
          <li>2.State Laws drill down into more specific spots (boxes perhaps)<br></li>
          <li>3.Municipal laws drill down even further to cover even more specifics<br></li>
        </ul>
         <p> Keeping this hierarchy in mind allows a programmer to avoid repetition and long drawn out code through the reuse of <b><em>"class rules"</em></b> for boxes that fit the same format and style.</p>
       </div>
          <div class="text">
      <p><em><b>So National law rules</b></em> unless something more specific is defined</p>
       </div> 
       <div class="summary">
         <p><b>Avoiding repitition or <em>Dry Code(don't repeat yourself)</em></b>  
        </p>
         <p>As defined in <b><em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em></b>“Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.”</p>
         <p> Looking at my code for this project I see what may be an example of what <em>DRY</em> code is referring to. I believe an example of this is that I share a "div class="summary" in some of my HTML. While this can be benificial in reducing the overall complexity of the code, it also makes it impossible for me to modify this "class" on on line of code without affecting something that I may not want it to change somewhere else in my HTML. The more complex the project, the more likely it is for this to cause issues.
